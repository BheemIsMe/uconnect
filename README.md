### What UCONNECT aims to solve?

Assume a scenario, where there are institutions and users, user wants to query a institution about any issue he has with it, uconnect introduces its way of establishing the communication between two entities

Where a user raises a thread to any institution, it opens a new chat window where he can communicate, once communication is closed, he can terminate the thread, which implies, he can't communicate over the thread any more.
